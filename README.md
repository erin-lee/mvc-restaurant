This is the parallax template used as a draft for an upcoming site.

The project will go through various stages until a complete web app is created and deployed.

The parallax scrolling responsive framework was built on top of the [Cool Kitten template](http://jalxob.com/cool-kitten/) by [@jalxob](https://twitter.com/Jalxob).  And the Cool Kitten template was built on top the [Stellar.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/)
